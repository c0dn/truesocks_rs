# TrueSocks SDK for Rust

`truesocks` is a Rust SDK for working with the TrueSocks API. The SDK provides a simple and convenient way to interact with the API to buy, rent, and manage proxies. 
It supports all API commands and abstracts away the complexity of making HTTP requests and handling JSON data.

## Features

- Simple API for buying, renting, and managing proxies
- Supports all commands from v2.1 of the API
- Easy-to-use functions and structs for working with the API
- Asynchronous design using `tokio` and `reqwest`

## Installation

Add the `truesocks` crate to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
truesocks = "0.1.0"
```
